Welcome to my homepage! Here I include some resources and LaTeX templates. Please feel free to email me if you have suggestions.

## LaTeX templates

I have long been searching for best LaTeX templates for a large range of purposes: letter, CV, resume, reports, and etc. Here I will share a collection of templates that I like. 

### Resume (for industry jobs)
One of the best LaTeX resume template is Jake's resume by Jake Gutierrez: [Overleaf Templates](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) and [Github](https://github.com/jakegut/resume/blob/master/README.md).

### CV (for academic jobs)
I have long been searching for a great CV template but couldn't find any. I guess perhaps established researchers in quantitative fields are too good with LaTeX that they can just write their own file. I am not that great with LaTeX thus I still need some help from already established templates. My CV is built following the instructions [here](https://www.tjansson.dk/2009/03/writing-a-cv-in-latex/) (by Thomas-Jansson). Another 2-column CV template can be found [here](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-graduate-cv). 

If you don't enjoy 2-column CV you could also use Jake's resume template to produce an academic CV. Another great CV template is the [ScottClarkCV](https://github.com/sc932/resume/blob/master/ScottClarkCV.pdf).

### Cover Letter
The template I use to write all letters can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/imperial-college-london-cover-letter-template/kdtqbsyyhnmb). Be sure to include a logo for your institution to make the letter more formal.

### Reports 
I found [this](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/sullivan-business-report) template to be very good in producing reports and written projects. The [LaTeX Templates](https://www.latextemplates.com/) website also contains other great templates that are worth to check out.

## Personal webpage

Creating a personal website can be done FREE! From my observation most students use Github or Google Sites to host their personal webpage. The tutorials are: [Google Sites](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310491?hl=en), [Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5g-lUuFgpg&ab_channel=TonyTeachesTech).

These tutorials can be easily followed through.

However, if you want to further elevate your webpage, you could use a template (yeah, like LaTeX templates that we just talked about). [Hugo Blox](https://hugoblox.com/templates/) provides great looking but FREE templates. My site is generated using Jekyll's [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) template.
