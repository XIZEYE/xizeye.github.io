Hello there! My name is Xize Ye, a PhD candidate at Western University under the supervision of [Prof. Marcos Escobar-Anel](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/marcos-escobar-anel.html) and [Prof. Lars Stentoft](https://economics.uwo.ca/people/faculty/stentoft.html). Our research focuses on the development of a novel class of Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Stochastic Heteroskedasticity (GARCSH) models with applications in financial derivative pricing. You can download my most recent CV [here](https://xizeye.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

I believe in the power of lifelong learning and exploration, and aim to make meaningful contributions both in my research and within my department. As a passionate educator, I strive to foster active, student-centered learning environments in mathematics, statistics and finance. Through ongoing participation in workshops and training programs, I continuously work to enhance my skills in teaching, communication, and conflict resolution.

Keep learning, keep going ~ üéâ. Just received the [edX verified certificate](https://xizeye.github.io/files/Stanford_SQL_certificate.pdf) for the [Stanford Online course in Relational Databases and SQL](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ydatabases0005-databases-relational-databases-and-sql)! Very helpful course with a detailed curriculum and practice tools, would definitely recommend! Another similar course is the [SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science) by UC Davis. Wishing everybody good luck on the journey of self improvement!üìà<br/><br/>

I am happy to announce that our research project, supervised by [Prof. Marcos Escobar-Anel](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/marcos-escobar-anel.html) and [Prof. Lars Stentoft](https://economics.uwo.ca/people/faculty/stentoft.html) is finally published by *Finance Research Letters* üòÄ. This paper explores which volatility index (VIX) maturity to use in affine GARCH model estimation. To rank models' forecasting performance, we utilize a novel modification, namely the model confidence class (MCC) upon the traditional and widely applied model confidence set (MCS) approach that will rank models in statistically comparably performing classes (tiers). In addition to the best-performing models, this procedure will also split the inferior models apart. With the help of MCC, our results show that 1-month VIX is an overall favourite üòÅ and 1-year VIX (VIX1Y) is the least desirable to use üò≠. [This paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2024.106053) is now open access. <br/><br/>

I passed the [Financial Risk Manager (FRM)](https://www.garp.org/frm) Exam Part I with [top quartiles (1111)](https://xizeye.github.io/files/frm.pdf) in all 4 subjects üòÅ. Topics in Part I give a holistic view of enterprise risk management and are beneficial to everyone working at finance firms. ~ One step further to the FRM designation ~. <br/><br/>
