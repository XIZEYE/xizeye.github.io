## 2023 - 2024 Faculty of Science Graduate Student Teaching Award

I am deeply honored to receive the 2023 - 2024 Faculty of Science Graduate Student Teaching Award. Being a student and working within the Faculty of Science, I am constantly immersed in an environment that values and advances teaching excellence. The faculty members of DSAS show their care and dedication every day toward students' academic success, serving as inspiring role models for graduate TAs like myself. I feel so privileged to be part of our department and faculty that promote and foster equitable, quality, and student-centered classrooms. This award shows a collective effort that would not be possible without the leadership of the management and staff members, and therefore I would like to thank the management faculty members at DSAS, the chair Professor Kristina Sendova, as well as Dr. Phuong Thao Dang for her help with administrative issues.
